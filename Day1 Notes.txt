Introduction:
==========
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. 
Java was started as a project called "Oak" by James Gosling in June 1991.
Java is an open source.
Java supports object oriented programming concepts.
		Object is an real world entity. Ex: Car,Bike,Animal,Pen,Pencil
Java is platform independent.???
platform means operating systems: windows,linux,mac,AIX,Solaris,Zlinux
Java is case sensitive. The uppercase and lowercase both are different.

int I=5;
int i=5;
 
System.out.println(i);-->5 // we get an error

int student;//lowercase
int STUDENT; //UPPERCASE
int Student;//mixed case
int i;
int I;
i=5;



Example: helloworld is different from HelloWorld

//This is my first java program
public class HelloWorld
{

	public static void main(String args[])//main is a method
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}

{} - Curly braces
[]-  Square Brackets
()-  paranthesis
;-   Semi colon
"-   Double Quotation
//- Comments

Class name is -> HelloWorld
Class Contains one main method

helloworld is different from HelloWorld why?? Java is case Sensitive

Points to be Noted:
---------------------
1. The Program name should be given as same name as class Name.
   ex: HelloWorld.java

2. The java program is saved with the extension '.java'.

3. Java Execution Flow->It has two steps....
  a. Compilation-> Checks the syntax errors
	Goto the command line and navigate to the location where the file is located and type->   
       javac HelloWorld.java

		(or)

        "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_XXX\bin\javac" HelloWorld.java


        Output -> HelloWorld.class(Contains bytecode)

   Java Bytecode->Java bytecode is the instruction set of the Java virtual machine.A Java programmer
   does not need to be aware of or understand Java bytecode at all.

  b. Execution-> JVM (Java virtual machine)is an interpreter(executes the code line-by-line)
     JVM converts the .class file generated during compilation phase into machine level language.

       pre-requisite-> HelloWorld.class

       java HelloWorld

       output->Prints "Hello World" in the console.

4. Java is platform independent-->".class" generated during compilation phase
works on all the platforms without any modifications. So, java is platform independent.

Ex: Compile a program on windows, and copy the .class to linux and execute the program on linux using
jvm.

JDK-Java Development kit
JRE-Java runtime environment
JVM-Java Virtual machine

Compile once and execute on any platform with specific jvm for the operating system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NetBeans,Rational Software Architect,Intellij

Eclipse is an IDE(Integrated dev Env) useful to create Java Proj,Write Java Programs
and Execute Java Programs.

Eclipse -> when we create a project two folders are created.

	src -> to store the java programs  Ex:HelloWorld.java

	bin -> to store the class files.    Ex: HelloWorld.class

Eclipse shortcuts -> syso ctrl+space-> System.out.println
	                 main ctrl+space->public static void main(String args[]){}
                     Execute ctrl+F11 ->Execute
*********

                     Opening shortcut editor in eclipse -> ctrl+shift+l
		             Quick outline -> ctrl+o 
                     Opening a resource -> ctrl+shift+r
		             Organizing imports -> ctrl+shift+o


Datatype:
---------------
Datatypes helps to store values in a variable. They are total 8 datatypes in java.


int x=5;

Datatype  -  Size
----------------------
byte	     1byte   8bits b=-128 to 127;  byte b = -128; 8 bits  -2 (power7) to 2 (power 7)-1
short	     2 bytes
int	     4 bytes                                          -2power 31 -1 to 2 power 31
long	     8 bytes for storing time in milliseconds. 10 *60*60*1000
            -----------Integers

float	     4 bytes  float f = 2.5f;
double       8 bytes  double d = 2.5;

	     ----------Decimal numbers

char	     2 byte Character code char c = 'a';
boolean	     true or false         boolean b = true;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
String is a class not a datatype. String is useful to store group of characters..

String s ="selenium";
String s ="Hello World";



Variable:
----------------
Variables helps to store the values. Also the name implies which varies the value
is called an variable.

		int i =10; // i is declared as int datatype and assigned a value '10'
                

		i=11;

                i=12;

		int i; // Declaration



		int i=5; Assigning a value of 5 in variable i of type integer.

		i=6;		


		LHS  =RHS;

		int i ;Declartion of integer variable

		i=5; //Assingment

                int i = 5; //Declaration & assignment in a single line of statement
 

		i=6;

	Declaration happens only once. But Assignment happens 'n' number of times


Rules for Creating Variable Names:
------------------------------------

1. Single Character is allowed for vnames.  Ex int i =10; 'i' is single character
2. Group of characters are allowed for vnames.Ex: boolean result = true;  ' result'
3. Alphanumeric characters are allowed for vnames. Ex: int a1 = 10;
    (Combination of characters and numbers) a1,b1,student1
4. Variable names should start with character but not numbers int 1a=10; // wrong
5. Keywords which are reserved/predefined cannot be used for vnames. 

  int public =10;// its not valid becoz public is an predefined keyword
